When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you need to change work station, or colliberate with someone.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Then I decide when it's a good time to pull into local, that might not fit.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Fork is clone in github, clone is to copy remote repositery, branch is to make change to own repo.
